## 🌊 I'm Julian, welcome to my GitHub 🦈

I'm a developer from Alsace (France), currently finishing my Master's degree in IT at Epitech. I'm looking to work on projects that genuinely improve people's everyday lives, locally or globally, by making technology simpler, more accessible, and more respectful of its users.

Right now, I'm building a suite of **local-first desktop tools** (PDF editing, conversion, background removal…). The idea is to offer everyday utilities that are accessible to disabled users, that work offline, and that aren't polluted by ads or tracking. I strongly believe that good software should be *light*, *privacy-friendly*, and *available to everyone*, regardless of bandwidth or hardware.

## Why I develop

I don't see IT as the field that will "save humanity" but I do believe it can solve real problems and help communities reconnect. Coding is one of the most accessible creative skills today, and it allows people to reclaim agency over their tools, their time, and their digital spaces.  
That's the kind of impact I want to contribute to.

## My strengths

I have a strong interest in **system design**, **data flows**, and building architectures that feel seamless to use. Clean code and maintainability matter a lot to me, not just for elegance, but so that others can build on top of what I create with ease.

I bring:
🐚 A structured, architectural mindset  

🐚 Strong attention to accessibility and eco-design principles

🐚 A sense for usability and simple UX 

🐚 Clean, scalable, SOLID-friendly code

🐚 The ability to think beyond business constraints and focus on real user needs
